START,Station's still got pressure which is good, but looks like the power's down. Let's get to the generator room, see if we can get it back on.
GENERATOR,Okay we're here, looks like the breaker switches just need throwing. They should be two, one in each security room, we'll need to hit them both at the same time.
RED SWITCH,Right, we've got power. Lab doors should now be unlocked, get on that teleporter, let's get over there and grab that hard drive.
FOUND LAB,This appears to be the laboratory. Let's see if we can find anything of use in here.
FOUND HDD,We've got it, let's get the hell out of here! Everyone, back to the airlock!
EVAC STARTED,We have 30 seconds until the escape ship leaves, let's hold this place off just a little longer.
MARINES WIN,Good job marines, mission complete.
ALIEN WINS,lol you all died.
