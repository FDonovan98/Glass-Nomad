START,Marines, you have one mission. Find the problem, neutralise it, and get out.
RED SWITCH,Pressing the switches simultaneously seemed to open something. Maybe we should go and check it out!
GENERATOR,Great! You have powered the generator on. That should make it easier to open the doors. We should go and check the lab.
FOUND LAB,This appears to be the laboratory. Let's see if we can find anything of use.
FOUND HDD,A hard drive! There might be valuable information on here. We better get out of here.
EVAC STARTED,We have 30 seconds until the escape ship leaves, let's hold this place off just a little longer.
MARINES WIN,Congratulations, Marines. You've successfully retrieved the information on board the ship.
ALIEN WIN,lol you all died.
