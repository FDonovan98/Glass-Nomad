  objectiveText: Boarding successful. Alright marines, our objective is the research
    data but power seems to be out. Station blueprints indicate there should be a
    generator room, head there and get power back on. Be careful, I see another life
    signal on the ship.
  objectiveHint: Locate the generator room
